# AI Flappy Bird Game

This project is a Python implementation of the classic *Flappy Bird* game, enhanced with AI capabilities using the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) library. The AI learns to play the game by training a population of neural networks to control the bird's actions.

## Features

- **Classic Flappy Bird Gameplay:** The game includes familiar mechanics like pipes, a bird with smooth animations, and a moving base.
- **AI-Powered Bird:** The bird is controlled by an AI that learns to navigate through pipes using neural networks.
- **NEAT Implementation:** Uses the NEAT-Python library to evolve the AI's neural networks over multiple generations.
- **Fitness-Based Evolution:** The AI's fitness increases as it survives longer and successfully passes pipes.
